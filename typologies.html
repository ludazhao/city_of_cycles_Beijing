          <h2>Types of Roads</h2>
          <h3>Categorizing Roads</h3>
            <p> During our two-week workshop in Beijing, we came up with a preliminary methodology of categorizing roads. Standing from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists, we tried to evaluate roads in terms of how friendly and inviting they are for people who walk and ride there.

Based on this principle, we walked and cycled extensively in the Wudaokou area near Tsinghua University, regarding it as a miniature of the Beijing city. From our observation and experience, we came out of six categories of roads. Referring to the Walk Score methodology, we used a scale of 1 to 6 to indicate the friendliness of a road for pedestrians and cyclists.
<ul>
<li><b>Very friendly.</b>  Such as pedestrian-only streets; wide bike lanes unoccupied by cars or vendors; clean and wide sidewalks, with good restaurants, cafes, tea places, etc.; plenty of benches for rest; large shadows under big trees; etc.

<li><b>Friendly. </b> Such as roads in residential areas. Usually they only have two lanes, with or without narrow sidewalks on each side. During the day, they are often not crowded and quite friendly for pedestrians and cyclists. At night, however, since some residents park their cars on the side, it can be difficult for them to get through once there are also cars passing.   

<li><b>Somewhat friendly.</b>  Such as roads that have 2 or 4 lanes for vehicles, with plenty of bars, cafes, restaurants, etc., on each side. The sidewalks are wide and unoccupied, so people can stay there longer or even stop. Traffic is not very crowded, so people can also cross the road quite easily, if they find something interesting on the other side. 

<li><b>Somewhat unfriendly.</b>  Such as roads that are quite empty, with few cars and wide sidewalks, but with few shops that can make pedestrians or cyclists stop.  

<li><b>Unfriendly.</b>  Such as wide roads that have 8 or 6 lanes for vehicles, but only have 2 narrow lanes for bikes. There may be plenty of shops on the two sides of the road, so a lot of people would walk or cycle there. However, their space is usually occupied by cars or vendors. Because the road is so wide, it is usually impossible for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road easily.

<li><b>Very unfriendly.</b> Such as ring roads or freeways that are only open to cars. 
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Guided by the same principle, we extended our scope to include not only road characteristics, such as the width of bike lanes and sidewalks, traffic signals for pedestrians and cyclists, crosswalks, etc., but also the facilities on the sides of the roads, including snack places, cafes, benches, trees, and others. A full list of the factors measured is listed below. We also derived the weights for each factor from several academic work. </p>

<p> Based on Dandan Tan(2007), Lin Zhao(2014) and Qiang Zhang(2010)’s research, we identified some factors which possibly influence the pedestrian’s comfort level. We then divided them into different categories, as shown below.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>After building the evaluation system, we also wanted to test its robustness. Given the impossibility of measuring all roads in Beijing, we determined to focus on some typical areas in Beijing. So we measured each road’s accessibility in a few sub centers of Beijing City, including Wudaokou, Zhongguancun, Wangfujin and Wangjing, using tools such Baidu Map and Google Earth. We calculated a score for each road using the weighted average. The higher the score is, we consider the road is friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<center> <h4>Wudaokou Area<h4></center>
<center><img width="50%" height = "50%" src="images/RoadsFigure4.jpg"/></center><br> 
<center> <h4>Zhongguancun Area<h4></center>
<center><img width="50%" height = "50%" src="images/RoadsFigure5.jpg"/></center><br>
<center> <h4>Wangfujing Area<h4></center>
<center><img width="50%" height = "50%" src="images/RoadsFigure6.jpg"/></center>
<h3>Moving Forward </h3>
<p> One thing notable is that as the functions of these areas vary from business centers to working centers, we may need to further investigate to what extent this kind of difference may affect the comfort level of pedestrians. We might have to adjust the weights assigned slightly to reflect this difference. 
This evaluation system must be more cogent as the road accessibility can be shown directly with quantificational method and each part of its overall grade will have a clear, reasonable and objective explanation.</p>
