          <h2> Noteworthy Places in Beijing's History</h2>
          <h3>1573</h3>
          <a name="forbidden" class="anchor"></a>
          <h4>Forbidden City</h4>
          <p>At the beginning of the 15th century AD, the third Ming Emperor, Yung-lo, took control of the imperial city used during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. He commanded that the Yuan palaces be razed in anticipation of the construction of the Forbidden Palace. The 9000 room palace took 15 years to be constructed and used materials from sites throughout the country. The Forbidden Palace had a symmetrical layout with buildings gilded with gold roofs and green, red, and yellow facings. From 1421 to 1911, the site was home to all of China’s emperors. The emperor would oversee processions for festivals and military victories from the front gate, Wumen Gate. With the resignation of the last emperor of China, Puyi, in 1912, the Forbidden City was handed over to Republican Authorities. With an agreement signed by the emperor and the new government, Puyi and his family was allowed to stay in the inner court, while the republican authorities took control of the outer court. Today, the Forbidden City is one of the largest museums in China and is a memento of China’s imperial past.</p>
          <a name="temple" class="anchor"></a>
          <h4>Temple of Heaven</h4>
          <p>Originally built in 1420, the Temple of Heaven has become the largest (larger than the Forbidden City) and most representative ancient sacrificial building in China.  Since its original construction, the site has been expanded and reconstructed two other times, once in the Ming dynasty and again in the Qing dynasty.  Prior to its opening to the public in 1988 and during the time of the emperors, the temple would be visited by the emperor once a year.  The emperor would visit during the winter solstice to worship Heaven and pray for good harvest.  The wall that encloses the site represents heaen on the northern side (with a semicircle configuration) and earth on the southern side (with a square configuration).  The site was later labeled as World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. </p>

          <h3>1700</h3>
          <a name="palace" class="anchor"></a>
          <h4>Summer Palace</h4>
          <p>The Summer Palace, also known as Yiheyuan in Chinese. As it is known today, the Summer Palace is 2.9 square kilometers with lakes, gardens, and palaces. The two largest geographical features are Kunming Lake and Longevity Hill. The beginnings of the Summer Palace can be traced to the Jin dynasty, 1153 AD, with the fourth ruler Wanyan Liang. Liang ordered the construction of a palace in the northwestern area of Beijing. It wasn’t until 1271 and 1272 that the city engineer started work on a water project to transport water from Shenshan Spring to the Western Lake, which would later become Kunming Lake. In 1494, the Hongzhi Emperor oversaw the construction of Yuanjing Temple on Jar Hill, the location of the future Longevity Hill. In the years that followed the temple fell into disrepair until the Zhengde Emperor chose to build a palace in the same location. In 1749 the lake was expanded and the Summer Palace was built in 1750, founded on the legend in Chinese mythology about three divine mountains. The palace was destroyed in 1860 and later restored in 1886. After the resignation of Puyi, the Summer Palace was opened to the public in 1914. It wasn’t until 1949 that the Palace served a political purpose, to house the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China. These days, the site is a UNESCO Heritage Site and one of the top historic sites in Beijing.</p>
