            <h2> Transportation and Quality of Life</h2>
            <h3> Introduction </h3>
            <p> Transportation is sometimes seen as the life blood of a city, allowing people to move with varying degrees of ease between their places of residences and places of work.  At one point, transportation in industrialized countries allowed people to access a higher quality of life, facilitating travel away from the unhealthy conditions of urban centers.  As auto technology has improved and surface transportation infrastructure has expanded through urban development and suburban expansion, the automobile and public transit have become a more critical part of daily life.  The United States saw this development occur during the 1950s and 1960s, whereas China has seen this phenomenon happen within the last 30 years.  Within the last few decades (both in the US and China), the roadway network that was seen as a means to expand urban centers, has fallen under acute criticism, specifically because of its negative impact on urban quality of life.  Surface transportation infrastructure, instead of improving quality of life by allowing people to live away from undesirable city centers, is now seen as a mechanism that increases congestion and promotes loss of economic productivity.  Combined with increased environmental stressors (results of the rise of the automobile), urban quality of life is being threatened in several ways.  Many researches have explored the causation and correlation of modern transportation and daily quality of life (or well-being). </p>

            <h3> The Factors Affecting Quality of Life </h3>
            <p> The following factors are metrics that can be used to quantify and compare quality of life in relationship to transportation.  Some of the factors are subjective (exercise, comfort, fit with lifestyle, etc.) and require individual interviews to understand the impact of transportation, while other factors are objective (cost, travel time, accidents, etc.) and can be determined based on external information sources. </p>

            <h3>Implications for the Future </h3>
            <p> Transportation is a huge factor in many of the decisions individuals make about their life. Within the last few decades, planners have started to take actions to reverse the negative impacts of the transportation system expansion.  It was between 1950 and 1990 that the global number of motorists grew by 600 million, leading to increased emissions, more congestion, and higher rates of traffic accidents (Steg & Gifford, 2005).  Campaigns emerged to persuade car users to reverse these impacts: shift to less polluting modes, change destination choices, combine trips, travel less, etc.  And, in effect planners started to implement techniques and strategies that would contribute to these.  The rebirth of multiuse development and increase of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure helped individuals switch to more sustainable transportation practices.  Whereas past urban design was a geometric practice of thought, the evolution of New Urbanism approached planning from a higher level organizational framework to better accommodate automobiles and account for quality of life.  Other policies for addressing transportation's impact on quality of life include: integrating transportation and land use planning, include public participation in planning processes, prioritize road based public transport such as bus rapid transit, subsidize transport fare, provide better bike and pedestrian infrastructure, implement road pricing schemes such as those in Singapore (Ahmed, Lu, & Ye, 2008).  </p>

            <h3>Quality of Life and Transportation in Beijing</h3>
            <p>Public transportation has become an essential part of transportation within the city.  The average commuting time is over 45 minutes, a result of the increasing amount of people and traffic congestion problems within the city.  Regardless of the congestion factors, surveys have shown a substantial percentage of the population feels indifferent towards public transportation (39.8%).  The same survey showed that 26.9% of the respondents were satisfied with the services and 21.2% were unsatisfied (Ji & Gao, 2010).  It was surprising to find that the most unsatisfied respondents were those with less than a 30 minute commute.  This could relate to the debate above regarding the effects of in transit activity or goal of the commute activities on the satisfaction of commuting.  In the years prior to the survey, Beijing had implemented many reforms, including opening of new lines, increased bus service, eliminating outmoded vehicles, launching subsidized fare rates.  Regardless of the efforts to improve transportation services, there has not been an effective improvement of quality of life among Beijing's residents.</p> 
            <p>Despite the assumptions that public transportation options provide more opportunities for all socio-economic classes, there is evidence that low socio-economic individuals spend more time and money commuting to and from work. In China, low income commuters spend approximately 1-2 hours on public transport to get to and from work and up to 2.4% of monthly discretionary income on transportation (Ahmed, Lu, & Ye, 2008).  Additionally, the poor spend more time commuting than the wealthy (Thynell, 2009).  This is a result of socio-spatial development and relates directly to the planning phases and ideologies implemented over the past fifty years.  These trends in transportation persist even though the middle class has grown 45% and daily trips has increased from 1-1.15 trips per day in 1986 to 3-3.5 trips per day in 2003 among richer Chinese cities (Thynell, 2009).  And, current transportation services in China only meet 10% of population needs of those below the poverty line.   The urbanization of Beijing has yet to slow down and the expansion of the peri-urban area comes with more opportunities for decision-makers and planners to plan for and promote more efficient and equitable means of transportation. </p>
