            <h2> Transportation in the Bay Area vs. Beijing </h2>
            <h3> Objective and Methodology </h3>
            <p> This section compares transportation system across cities, with a focus on Beijing and the Bay Area. Comparative perspectives help us understand the bigger picture of urban challenges across cities. We hope this section also motivates you to think about transportation development in your own hometown. <p>

            <h3> Understanding Mode Shares across cities </h3>
            <p> According to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP), mode share is defined as "the share of the region's travel that is made by different modes of Transportation." Oftentimes, cities-rather than another unified entities-conduct surveys to gauge mode shares. In our study, we focus on mode shares because observing modes of transportation enables comparison between cities and times. Since each city categorizes and breaks down mode shares differently, in order to make the comparison easier, we summarized the figures in Figure 1. <br>
<b>What you find from these figures?</b>
A characteristic of Beijing is lower shares of non-motorized modes. 
San Francisco records high private transportation shares. Considering its high population density, this can easily lead to congestion. 
<br><b>What affect people's choices?</b>
It is important to remember that mode shares are influenced by various socioeconomic factors such as household incomes and land use patterns. If you're interested, please consider what factors contribute to characteristics in mode shares in a city you choose.

        <h3> Trends and Challenges in Beijing and the Bay Area </h3>
        <p>Beijing and the Bay Area face common challenges such as increased usage of private cars and decreased usage of non-motorized modes. These changes require managing congestion and environmental pollution. 
<p><br><b>Beijing</b><br>

 Figure 2 shows the historical changes of transportation mode shares in Beijing. Comparing 1986 to the present, there was an expansion in both private car usage and subway usage. Meanwhile, bike usage decreased significantly. We can see both the development of railway systems as well as increased usage of private cars as the city expanded over time.
Accessibility, environmental concerns and traffic congestions pose challenges in Beijing. Since increased usage of private cars and decreased usage of bikes are intensifying the problems, Chinese megacities have implemented a quota policy to control car ownership growth. On the other had, cycling has many advantages both for reducing environmental pollution and congestion. China's big cities, including Beijing has introduced bike-sharing system from 2000s. </p>

<p><br><b>Bay Area</b><br>

Figure3-1 and 3-2 show the historical changes of transportation mode shares in the Bay Area. Although the scope of the statistics is limited for workers only, it is useful to examine these figures because commuting accounts for large portion of transportation usage, therefore affecting quality of life. In Figure 3-1, we can see that private driving has been the dominant mean of commuting over time -around 70%-in the Bay Area. Meanwhile, it is interesting to see a gradual increase in "Work at Home" from 2% to 10% in three decades. We should consider absolute increases in the number of commuters in addition to mode shares. For example, the number of commuters in "Drive Alone" category alone increased by almost one million in three decades. Along with this, the average travel time to work is in increasing trends. Meanwhile, the population has also increased significantly. </p>

<h3>Beyond Numbers: how do people feel? </h3>

<p>Through our in-depth interviews in the Bay Area, we found insightful stories to compare peopleâ€™s experiences across cities and over time. Do you feel similar or different? </p>

<p><b>Near the Portsmouth Square.</b> A businessman in his 50s told us that the transportation within the city is excellent, but that around the bay is less satisfying. He lived in the city before moving to Los Angeles, where he considered his quality of life was usually compromised because of long commuting time. In contrast, he believes that life in San Francisco is more balanced. This experience is interesting in that it shows how people's perception can be influenced by their benchmark, and in this case, where they have lived. </p>

<p><b>At the Ferry Building.</b> Two elderly men in their 70s on a bench near the Ferry Building spent over 30 minutes for the interview. They shared their feelings about the transportation, people and society. They drove from Mission Dolores Park to the Ferry Building. Although they were generally satisfied with the transportation situation in the Bay Area, they pointed out that the housing is becoming more expensive and the city is getting more crowded over time, especially public transportation like muni. They mentioned that sometimes people feel insecure because of eccentric people who make big noises or attack other riders in transit. However, they told us that it is important to understand and care for people who acted strangely because they were often the kind of people who were isolated from the society and needed some help. Their story is insightful in that they are connecting transportation experience with social problems such as gentrification and poverty.</p>
